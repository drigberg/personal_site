            <p id="coding_bio">My primary languages are Javascript and Python, and I enjoy using them
              for such topics as language processing, data visualization, and machine learning. I
              originally studied music composition at Yale University, but since graduating have found
              that I much prefer music as a hobby than a career. After some time spent intensively teaching myself
              Node.JS, I became a Python/Django developer in the real estate tech field before ending up at
              the Recurse Center, where I studied D3 and honed my javascript, design, and algorithm skills.<p>
